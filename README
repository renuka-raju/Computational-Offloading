I have implemented a computational offloading model to calculate the end to end delay of a given link<br>
The model encompasses an aws server, 2 database servers, a computational server and a monitor to display the results<br>
The client can request the server by giving an id to the link, file size and signal power<br>
The aws server will then query the backend server A and B for information about this link<br>
If the backend servers A and B have details of the link in their respective databases, they return them to the aws server<br>
Aws server send these details to the computational server c - server C caluclates the transmission delay, propagation delay<br>
and end-to-tnd delay for the link with given parameters and then returns it to the aws server<br>
Now, aws server returns the results to the client<br>
The aws server sends information to the monitor to display the link query obtained from the client <br>
and the results obtained from the backend server C.
